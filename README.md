TNSMD is a toolbox for proteogenomic approaches to detect small peptides encoded by non-classical sORFs

TNSMD provides functions including: construction of annotation files for Ribo-seq analysis based on assembled transcripts, construction of a proteogenomics index based on Ribo-seq analysis results (or data from public databases), visualisation of the results of the subgroup FDR control, screening of peptides and merging of intensities.
